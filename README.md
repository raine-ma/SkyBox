My attempt to try and learn some web development. This provides a web interface for utilizing Discord as storage space, Implemented in Flask, can be hosted locally or online. 

To use the application, you will need to create a Community Server in Discord with threads enabled, a Discord Bot with access to read messages in the server, and Discord webhook with the ability to create threads. 

Set the env variable ```url``` to your webhook url, and ```Do``` to the bot token.
